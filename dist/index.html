  <h1><span class="large">Digging</span> <span class="small">for</span> 14,000 Years</h1>
  <h2>Visit an Archaeological Dig at One of the Oldest Known Settlements in North America</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      Travel back in time to 14,000 years ago. Enormous ice sheets cover most of
      Canada. Giant ground sloths and sabre-toothed cats roam the plains of what
      is now the southern United States. After crossing Beringia, the landmass
      that connects Asia with Alaska, humans began to travel southward along the
      resource-rich coastline.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have scant evidence of people from this time period, but an
      archaeological site in coastal British Columbia has cracked open a door
      into this Ice Age world. Scroll through the archaeological excavation on
      Triquet Island—layer by layer—and uncover one of the oldest repeatedly
      occupied settlements in North America.

      <h1>The Excavation</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      An expert team of archaeologists spent weeks carefully sifting and
      examining more than five cubic meters of excavated material. That's
      equivalent to half of a cement mixing truck of soil, sand, clay, and
      rocks—all excavated by hand. The archaeologists separated artifacts,
      animal bones, and other evidence of human habitation, and meticulously
      recorded the exact sediment layer where each item originated. We zoomed in
      to a three-meter deep by one-meter wide wall to profile the deepest
      section at the archaeological site.

      <h1>(Un)stable Sea Levels</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      If you could travel back in time 14,000 years, you wouldn’t recognize the
      shape of British Columbia’s coastline. Vancouver is under a glacier. A
      vast dry plain takes the place of Hecate Strait between Haida Gwaii and
      the mainland. Sea levels rise and fall as glaciers grow and shrink, and as
      tectonic plates shift. The area around Triquet Island is an exception.
      Through a serendipitous combination of factors, sea levels in this area of
      the Central Coast stayed relatively stable, which has created a unique
      opportunity for archaeologists.

      <h1>The Shifting Story of Bones</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      The deeper, older layers contain mostly bones
      <a class="artifactlink artifactlink3" href="#artifactlink3">3</a>
      from sea mammals, such as seals and sea lions. In contrast, the shallower
      layers reveal a shift toward a fishier diet for people. In more recent
      times, herring, salmon, rockfish, and lingcod played a more prominent role
      as technologies and culture changed.

      <h1>Volcano Glass Trade</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Obsidian
      <a class="artifactlink artifactlink4" href="#artifactlink4">4</a>, a type
      of volcanic glass, was a precious material. Obsidian cutting instruments
      can be sharper than a surgeon’s blade. But you need a volcano to make
      obsidian and the closest source to Triquet Island is at Anahim Lake more
      than 200 kilometers away. Enter trade. Coastal peoples traded resources
      for obsidian that interior peoples could not access; such as the valuable
      fish oil from a silvery smelt called eulachon.

      archaeological discoveries from Triquet Island reaffirm the Heiltsuk oral
      history passed down over generations. Interview by Christie Taylor, as

    <p>
      Smaller test cores show that there are layers of older clay below the
      anvil stone <a class="artifactlink artifactlink6" href="#artifactlink6">6</a>, although no artifacts have been
      found in these layers. However, recent
      analysis from Hakai Institute geoscientists showed that Triquet Island was
      glacier-free around 16,800 years ago. Even older settlement sites in the
      region are therefore not out of the realm of possibility. The archaeology
      story continues.

        <p>
          This band of grey sediment, and another like it, deeper in the hole,
          are the telltale markers of a catastrophic event. People across the
          region passed down

            >numerous oral history accounts</a
          >
          of large earthquakes and tsunamis over generations. At least two
          massive tsunamis hit the Triquet Island region between 5,000 and 7,000
          years ago.

        <h3>Bone Needle in a Haystack</h3>
        <p>
          In the upper excavated layers, archaeologists found the top half of a
          needle carved from a mammal’s bone. Reassembling a 6,000-year- old
          broken artifact is like trying to construct a jigsaw puzzle without
          knowing if you have all the pieces. Months later, among the thousands
          of animal bones strewn across the table, archaeologist Alisha Gauvreau
          picked up a matchstick-sized sliver of bone. She retrieved the top of
          the needle from its storage drawer. The two bone fragments matched.
          The needle took its complete shape for the first time in millennia.

        <h3>What's an Atlatl?</h3>
        <p>
          In many environments, wood artifacts are the first to disintegrate.
          But perpetually wet sites, like Triquet Island, provide perfect
          conditions to preserve otherwise rare wooden objects. One of the most
          interesting wooden artifacts found at Triquet was a spear-thrower, or
          atlatl (pronounced ah-till- ah-till).
        </p>
        <p>
          Atlatls act as an extension of your arm to help propel a spear, much
          like tennis ball throwers people use to play fetch with their dog. A
          spur, likely made of bone, would have been hafted to the hole at the
          top. Atlatls are ubiquitous—found in archaeological deposits from
          Australia to France to Mexico.

        <h3>An Anvil Stone</h3>
        <p>
          The archaeology team had to stop digging two and a half meters [more
          than 8 feet] from the surface. Cemented sediments comprised of compact
          gravel, pebbles, silt, and sand prevented deeper exploration at this
          excavation site.
        </p>
        <p>
          At around this depth, they found a pile of lithics—sharp,
          multi-purpose stone tools—strewn atop a large boulder. The boulder was
          an anvil stone, used as a hard surface to smash smaller rocks against
          to produce flaked stone tools. Charcoal collected from an adjacent
          ancient fireplace was radiocarbon dated to between 13,613 and 14,086
          years ago, which makes Triquet Island one of the oldest known
          settlement sites in North America.
